    "We have split this assignment over two days, so that you can become more comfortable with material. On the first day, you will build the basics of the forest fire model and the second day you will analyze the model and the tipping point! Let's get started!\n",

    "### Why model forest fires?\n",
    "\n",
    "While this isn't a huge problem in Michigan, the _states in the western United States having been suffering a tremendous problem with huge and difficult-to-control forest fires_.  This comes from a combination of extended drought conditions, dense woodlands, and forest management policies that suppress small fires and thus ensure that large quantities of dead, dry trees and brush are available to burn when a large fire inevitably starts (typically from lightning strikes, but occasionally from negligent campers, or recently from gender-reveal celebrations).  In recent years, this has been exacerbated by climate change, which has both caused drought conditions to be more severe and allowed tree-killing diseases and insects to flourish, which produces more dead, easily-burned wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "These forest fires destroy ecosystems and peoples' homes and other property, and can result in the loss of human and animal life.  A key challenge in forest management is to attempt to contain these huge forest fires once they start, in order to protect human lives, settlements, and infrastructure.  To that end, it is critical to have models of how fire spreads in various conditions; see, for example, the [Open Wildland Fire Modeling group](https://www.openwfm.org/wiki/Open_Wildland_Fire_Modeling_E_community_Wiki).\n"

    "## The Rules for Our Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "The model is a two-dimensional square $N \\times N$ array that represents the forested region we're simulating.  **The cells in the array can have three values:** \n",
    "- **0 (empty)** \n",
    "- **1 (trees)** \n",
    "- **2 (on fire)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the model, a user-specified fraction of the cells $f_\\text{trees_start}$ are randomly filled with trees and the remaining cells are empty.  \n",
    "**One edge of the board (say, the entire leftmost column) is set on fire.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighborhoods\n",
    "Each cell has a \"neighborhood\" that is composed of its four neighbors to the left, right, above, and below it. **If a cell is along one of the edges of the array, only consider the neighbors that it has** (i.e., don't try to go out of the bounds of the array).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/zH9YL38/indexing-example.png\" alt=\"indexing-example\" border=\"0\" width=200px></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolving with Time\n",
    "The model takes steps forward in time, where every cell is modified based on the previous step.  The model evolves as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **If the cell was empty last turn, it stays empty this turn.**\n",
    "* **If the cell is a tree and any of its neighbors were on fire last turn, it catches on fire.**\n",
    "* **If the cell was on fire last turn, the fire has consumed all of the trees and it is now empty.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ending Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**The model evolves forward in time until all of the fires have burned out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "After this happens, you can calculate the fraction of the cells that still have trees at the end of the model ($f_\\text{trees_end}$) and the fraction of cells that are empty ($f_\\text{empty}$).  The fraction of burned cells, $f_\\text{burned}$, is just the difference between the fraction of cells that were initially trees and the fraction of cells that are trees at the end of the model; in other words,\n",
