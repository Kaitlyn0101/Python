    "In this project, your group is going to calculate an answer one of the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many grams of caffeine get consumed on MSU's campus each week?  \n",
    "2. How much does the air above Lake Superior weigh?\n",
    "3. If somebody left one of the bathroom faucets running at the Breslin Center, how long would it take to fill it up with water?  \n",
    "4. If all of the toilet paper used per week in the United States were rolled out across the surface of Michigan could you cover the entire state? If so, could you cover it more than once?\n",
    "5. Which has more mass, the air in this classroom or the brains in this classroom?  \n",
    "6. On average, how many people are airborne in the world at a given moment?  \n",
    "7. How many total miles do all Americans drive in their cars in one year, and how does this compare to the circumference of the Earth ($2.5 \\times 10^4$ miles), the distance from the Earth to the Sun ($9 \\times 10^7$ miles), and size of the Solar System ($10^9$ miles)?\n",

    "1. The questions that you need to ask and answer to come up with an estimate for your problem.\n",
    "2. The equation(s) you will need to solve your problem.\n",
    "3. The reasonable values that would go into the equation(s).\n",
